Implementing object detection models on a fashion products dataset : https://fashionpedia.github.io/home/

1. YOLOv5 model trained on this dataset!! 
We have trained 4 different models of YOLOv5 and chose the best out of them - yolo_2_5k_100_epochs.ipynb

2. Streamlit.py is the python script for a web app of the YOLO trained model.

3. Color_classification is a multi class image classification model
